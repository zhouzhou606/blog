## Hexo
[Hexo](https://hexo.io/) is a tiny and ease to use blog framework.
### A demo for hexo
#### init new site
``` bash
$ hexo init hello
```
#### start service
``` bash
$ cd hello && hexo server
```
#### open browse and enter
``` bash
http://localhost:4000
```
The page would show some hexo cmds. Looks ease, simple and clean. That's why I choose hexo to build my blog.
